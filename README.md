# arduino_shell Library

a_sh is a WIP Arduino library that allows user to create custom commands in an Arduino sketch, which can be executed via serial communication. For the most integrated experience, use the [a_sh CLI](https://github.com/zam-5/a_sh-CLI).

## Example Syntax

```
  read-analog <PIN>
  read-digital <PIN>
  write-digital <PIN> <HIGH or LOW>
  write-analog <PIN> <0-255>
```
